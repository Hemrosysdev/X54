The test requirements have been generated and inserted in the document with help of a tool.

**Content of a test case**

    *Test case statistics*


	Each test case has a testcase name, an ID, a configuration, properties and requirements.
	The ID is unique within the project and has the form of a GUID.
	References within this document are created on the basis of bookmarks to this GUID.
	So it is possible to navigate interactivelly in the electronic document.
	At the end of the document there is an alphanumerically sorted list of all GUIDs for the test case names.

    *Assemblies*


	Assemblies supplement a test case description. These can be PDF documents but also other auxiliary files.


    *Description*

        For each test case a human readable, understandable description is provided.
